# Green JWT

  Node.js implementation of JSON Web Token (JWT) with support for signatures (JWS), encryption (JWE) and web keys (JWK). 

  "*JSON Web Token (JWT) is a means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that may be digitally signed using JSON Web Signature (JWS) and/or encrypted using JSON Web Encryption (JWE).*"

  The suggested pronunciation of JWT is the same as the English word "jot".

  This package is aimed to implements the following IETF drafts:

  * [JWT](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-jones-json-web-token-10) draft-jones-json-web-token-10
  * [JWA](https://www.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-algorithms-02.txt) draft-ietf-jose-json-web-algorithms-02
  * [JWS](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-signature-02) draft-ietf-jose-json-web-signature-02
  * [JWE](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-encryption-02) draft-ietf-jose-json-web-encryption-02
  * [JWK](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-key-02) draft-ietf-jose-json-web-key-02


  But currently we only support **JWT** with **JWS** and the following **JWA** signing algorithms

  * NONE 
  * HMAC 
    * HS256
    * HS384
    * HS512
  * RSA 
    * RS256 
    * RS384 
    * RS512


  As we move forward we will add additional **JWA** algorithms and support for **JWE**. Please submit any comments and suggestions.
